# Deep Learning using PyTorch

* This repository contains notebooks for creating deep learning models in PyTorch. 
* The notebooks are based on the ones in the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning-with-python-bootcamp/
* The notebooks in the MyNotes folder have my annotations in them (with additional explanaton when needed). It also contains many notebooks that have been converted to train on a GPU (whicg was missing in the original course)
